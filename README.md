# Basic strategy:
Put your 'Marker's (cheapest object) to own some land. You can put your objects anywhere on the map, but if you put them as the neighbor of at least one of your object, you get 10 points for each. Destroy your opponents land by putting more valuable objects on their objects and split their land into pieces. Dominate a united & valuable land and win!
